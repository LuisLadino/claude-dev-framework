```bash
./scripts/validate-setup.sh
```

ðŸ’¡ **Keep backups** - Scripts do this automatically, but you can also:
```bash
cp -r .claude/your-stack .claude/your-stack.backup
```

ðŸ’¡ **Update regularly** - Monthly or quarterly
```bash
./scripts/update-framework.sh
```

ðŸ’¡ **Check health score** - Should be 90%+
```bash
./scripts/validate-setup.sh
# Look for "Health Score: XX%"
```
