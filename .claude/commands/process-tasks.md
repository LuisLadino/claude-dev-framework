# /process-tasks - Execute Task List

**Build complex features step-by-step, adapted to your tech stack.**

Use after `/generate-tasks` to implement a feature one subtask at a time.

---

## Overview

This command:
- Reads your task list
- Loads your stack configuration  
- Executes ONE subtask at a time
- Runs `/start-task` workflow for each
- Verifies after each subtask
- Waits for your approval
- Commits after each parent task
- Can pause/resume anytime

---

## STEP 1: Load Stack Configuration

**Before starting, understand the tech stack:**

Use `project_knowledge_search`:
```
Query: "stack-config.yaml configuration"
```

**Extract:**
- Framework and version
- Language
- Styling solution
- Testing framework
- Package manager
- Active standards

**This ensures each subtask follows your stack's patterns**

---

## STEP 2: Select Task List

```
⚙️  **PROCESS TASKS FROM LIST**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Looking for task lists in .claude/tasks/...

Found task lists:
1. tasks-0001-prd-project-filtering.md (15 subtasks, 3 complete)
2. tasks-0002-prd-contact-form.md (12 subtasks, 0 complete)
3. tasks-0003-prd-dark-mode.md (18 subtasks, 0 complete)

Which task list should I use? (number or filename)
```

**Or specify directly:**
```
/process-tasks tasks-0003-prd-dark-mode.md
```

---

## STEP 3: Read Task List & Assess Progress

```
📖 **READING TASK LIST**

File: .claude/tasks/tasks-0003-prd-dark-mode.md

**Stack:** [Framework] + [Language] + [Styling] + [Testing]
**PRD:** 0003-prd-dark-mode.md

**Progress:**
- Total parent tasks: 6
- Total subtasks: 18
- Completed: 0
- Remaining: 18

**Next Up:**
- [ ] 1.0 Set up feature structure
  - [ ] 1.1 Create [framework] component directory
  - [ ] 1.2 Create [framework] component files
  - [ ] 1.3 Create test files per [test framework]
  - [ ] 1.4 Add barrel exports

Ready to start? (yes/no)
```

---

## STEP 4: Execute Subtasks (ONE AT A TIME)

### For Each Subtask:

```
🔨 **SUBTASK: [X.Y] [Title]**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What:** [Description from task list]

**Purpose:** [Why this subtask exists]

**Will create/modify:**
- [file 1]
- [file 2]

**Standards applying:**
- [framework]-standards.md
- [language]-standards.md
- file-structure.md

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Executing /start-task workflow for this subtask...**
```

### Apply /start-task Workflow

**For EACH subtask, run complete `/start-task` workflow:**

1. **Load standards** (already loaded from stack-config)
2. **Show Standards Check**:

```
📋 **STANDARDS CHECK FOR SUBTASK [X.Y]**

**Stack:** [Framework] + [Language] + [Styling]

**Subtask:** [X.Y] [Title]

**Approach:**
[How this will be implemented]

**Standards Loaded:**
✓ [framework]-standards.md - [Key patterns]
✓ [language]-standards.md - [Key rules]
✓ [styling]-standards.md - [Styling approach]
✓ file-structure.md - [Organization]
✓ testing-standards.md - [If tests involved]

**Files to create/modify:**
- [file 1] - [Purpose]
- [file 2] - [Purpose]

**Framework patterns:**
- [Pattern 1 specific to their framework]
- [Pattern 2 specific to their framework]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Should I proceed with this subtask? (yes/no)
```

**⏸️ WAIT FOR APPROVAL**

3. **Execute subtask** (following their framework patterns)
4. **Verify changes**:

```
🔍 **VERIFYING SUBTASK [X.Y]**

Running checks:
- Format: [formatter command]
- Lint: [linter command]
- Type check: [if TypeScript]
- Build: [build command]
- Tests: [test command if tests exist]

Results:
✓ Format: Pass
✓ Lint: Pass
✓ Type check: Pass
✓ Build: Pass
✓ Tests: Pass

All checks passed!
```

5. **Mark subtask complete**:

```
✅ **SUBTASK [X.Y] COMPLETE**

[x] [X.Y] [Title]

**Created:**
- [file 1]
- [file 2]

**Verified:** All checks passed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Progress:**
Parent Task [X.0]: [completed]/[total] subtasks done
Overall: [completed]/[total] subtasks done

Next subtask: [X.Y+1] [Title]

Ready to continue? (yes/no/pause)
```

**⏸️ WAIT FOR APPROVAL**

---

## STEP 5: After Parent Task Complete

When ALL subtasks in a parent task are done:

```
🎉 **PARENT TASK [X.0] COMPLETE**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ [X.0] [Parent task name]
  ✓ [X.1] [Subtask]
  ✓ [X.2] [Subtask]
  ✓ [X.3] [Subtask]
  ✓ [X.4] [Subtask]

**Running full test suite...**

[Run complete test suite]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Test Results:**
✓ Unit tests: [X] passed
✓ Integration tests: [Y] passed
✓ Total: [X+Y] tests passed

All tests passing!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Ready to commit parent task [X.0]**

**Files to commit:**
- [file 1]
- [file 2]
- [file 3]
- [test file 1]
- [test file 2]

**Suggested commit message:**

## Enforcement

**CRITICAL RULES (VIOLATION = UNACCEPTABLE):**

1. **ONE subtask at a time**
   - Complete subtask
   - Verify it works
   - Mark it [x]
   - STOP and wait for approval
   - Never continue without "yes"

2. **Standards on every subtask**
   - Execute /start-task workflow for each
   - Show standards check
   - Wait for approval
   - Follow framework patterns exactly

3. **Verify before marking complete**
   - Run all checks (format, lint, type-check, build, test)
   - Fix any failures
   - Only mark [x] when all checks pass

4. **Commit after each parent task**
   - When all subtasks in parent are [x]
   - Run full test suite
   - If tests pass: stage, clean, commit
   - Mark parent task [x]
   - Continue to next parent task

5. **Never skip verification**
   - Every subtask: verify checks pass
   - Every parent task: verify full test suite passes
   - No shortcuts

**If user says "Standards?":**
- Stop immediately
- Execute `/standards` command
- Restart current subtask from beginning
- Show complete standards check

## Tips for Success

### DO:
✅ Review standards check for each subtask
✅ Let verification run completely
✅ Fix failures immediately
✅ Pause when needed
✅ Read what was built

### DON'T:
❌ Skip approval checkpoints
❌ Continue with failed checks
❌ Rush through subtasks
❌ Ignore test failures
❌ Commit broken code

---

## Workflow Summary

```
For each subtask:
  1. Show standards check
  2. Wait for approval
  3. Execute subtask (following stack patterns)
  4. Verify (format, lint, type-check, build, test)
  5. Mark subtask [x]
  6. Show progress
  7. STOP - Wait for "yes"
  8. If "yes": Continue to next subtask

When all subtasks in parent task complete:
  1. Run full test suite
  2. Stage changes (git add .)
  3. Generate commit message (framework-aware)
  4. Wait for approval
  5. Execute commit
  6. Mark parent task [x]
  7. Show commit summary
  8. STOP - Wait for "yes"
  9. If "yes": Continue to next parent task

When all parent tasks complete:
  Show feature complete summary
```

**This is the complete workflow. Follow it exactly.**
