# /learn - Explain Anything

Explains concepts, code, or anything else in plain English.

```
/learn                     # Explain the last thing we worked on
/learn [topic or question] # Explain anything
```

## How to Respond

### If no topic given
Explain the last thing built or discussed. Cover what it is, how it works, and why it's done that way.

### If topic given
Explain it clearly:

1. **What it is** - One sentence, no jargon
2. **Why it matters** - The problem it solves
3. **How it works** - Simple breakdown
4. **Example** - Concrete illustration
5. **Related concepts** - What to learn next (optional)

---

## Principles

- **No jargon** - Define technical terms when first used
- **Use analogies** - Connect to familiar concepts
- **Be concrete** - Examples over abstractions
- **Adjust depth** - Simple first, add detail if asked
- **Be honest** - Say when something is genuinely complex

---

## Examples

**User:** `/learn`
→ Explain the component/function/feature just created

**User:** `/learn react hooks`
→ Explain what hooks are, why they exist, how to use them

**User:** `/learn why is the sky blue`
→ Explain light scattering in simple terms

**User:** `/learn kubernetes`
→ Explain container orchestration without assuming DevOps knowledge

## Tone

Be clear, not condescending. Don't say "it's simple" or "obviously". If something is hard, acknowledge it and break it down further.

End by inviting follow-up questions.
