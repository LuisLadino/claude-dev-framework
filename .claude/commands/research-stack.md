# /research-stack

**Research a technology stack and generate comprehensive standards**

---

## Purpose

This command uses AI tools to research unfamiliar technology stacks and automatically generate accurate, current coding standards based on official documentation and community best practices.

**Use when:**
- Starting a project with a new stack
- Joining a team using unfamiliar technologies
- Updating standards for new framework versions
- Need quick onboarding to a technology

**Time:** 15-30 minutes for complete research

---

## Prerequisites

### Recommended Setup (Best Results)

**For optimal research quality, you need:**

‚úÖ **context7 MCP server** - Fetches official documentation directly
- Install: See [MCP Integration Guide](../tools/mcp-integration.md)
- Setup: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac)
- Why: Gets full, accurate docs instead of summaries

‚ö†Ô∏è **Without context7:** Research falls back to web search (limited accuracy)

### Optional (Enhances Results)

- `github` MCP - Find real-world examples in popular repos
- `filesystem` MCP - Analyze your existing codebase patterns

---

## How It Works

This command follows the [Stack Research Workflow](../workflows/stack-research.md) and uses:

**With context7 (Recommended):**
- `context7` - Fetch official documentation pages directly
- `web_search` - Find best practices and current trends
- `web_fetch` - Read complete documentation
- `github` (optional) - Find real-world examples
- `filesystem` (optional) - Check existing code

**Without context7 (Fallback):**
- `web_search` - Find official docs and best practices (limited)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Results may be less accurate without direct doc access

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```
/research-stack
```

Claude will ask you questions and guide you through the process.

### Quick Start

```
/research-stack Next.js 14 with Prisma and tRPC
```

Provide your stack upfront to skip the initial questions.

---

## Interactive Flow

### Step 0: Prerequisites Check (FIRST)

**Before starting, Claude MUST check for context7:**

```
üîç CHECKING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES

Checking for MCP tools...

‚úÖ web_search available (basic research)
‚úÖ web_fetch available (documentation reading)
‚ùå context7 NOT available

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Limited Research Quality

Without context7, I can only use web search for research.
This means:
- Generic summaries instead of full official docs
- Potentially outdated information
- Less accurate framework-specific details

RECOMMENDED: Install context7 MCP server for best results
See: .claude/tools/mcp-integration.md

Options:
1. Continue anyway (web search only)
2. Cancel and set up context7 first
3. Skip and use /import-standards instead

What would you like to do?
```

**If context7 IS available:**
```
üîç CHECKING RESEARCH CAPABILITIES

‚úÖ context7 available (fetch official docs)
‚úÖ web_search available (best practices)
‚úÖ web_fetch available (documentation)

Ready to research with full capabilities!
```

### Step 1: Stack Discovery

**Claude asks:**
```
What technology stack are you using?

Please include:
- Framework/library (e.g., Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit)
- Version if known (e.g., Next.js 14)
- Database/ORM (e.g., Prisma, Drizzle)
- Styling solution (e.g., Tailwind CSS)
- Testing framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest)
- Other key technologies
```

**You provide:**
```
Next.js 14 (app router)
Prisma with PostgreSQL
tRPC for API
Tailwind CSS
Vitest for testing
TypeScript
```

### Step 2: Knowledge Gap Assessment

**Claude asks:**
```
Which technologies are you familiar with?

Rate each:
- ‚úÖ Know well
- üü° Somewhat familiar
- ‚ùå Need to learn

Next.js: [your rating]
Prisma: [your rating]
tRPC: [your rating]
etc.
```

**Purpose:** Focuses research on what you actually need to learn

### Step 3: Research Phase

**Claude performs research:**
```
üîç Researching Next.js 14...
   ‚úì Found official documentation
   ‚úì Reading App Router guide
   ‚úì Checking recent best practices

üîç Researching tRPC...
   ‚úì Found official docs
   ‚úì Reading integration guides
   ‚úì Checking Next.js + tRPC patterns

üîç Researching integration patterns...
   ‚úì Next.js + Prisma setup
   ‚úì tRPC + Prisma integration
   ‚úì Testing strategies for this stack
```

**You see:** Progress updates as Claude researches each component

### Step 4: Standards Generation

**Claude creates:**
```
üìÑ Generating standards files...

Created: .claude/your-stack/coding-standards/nextjs-standards.md
Created: .claude/your-stack/coding-standards/typescript-standards.md
Created: .claude/your-stack/architecture/folder-structure.md
Created: .claude/your-stack/architecture/component-patterns.md
Created: .claude/your-stack/testing-standards.md
Created: .claude/your-stack/stack-config.yaml
```

### Step 5: Review & Customize

**Claude shows summary:**
```
‚úÖ Research Complete!

Generated standards for:
- Next.js 14 App Router patterns
- Prisma schema and migrations
- tRPC router structure
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Vitest setup with React Testing Library

üìã Key Findings:
- Use Server Components by default
- tRPC routers in src/server/trpc/
- Prisma schema in prisma/schema.prisma
- Collocate tests with source files

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any of these standards
2. Modify something
3. Generate example code
4. Proceed with /start-task
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find information about X"

**Possible causes:**
- Technology is very new (pre-release)
- Uncommon combination
- Proprietary/internal tool

**Solutions:**
1. Provide more context about the technology
2. Share documentation links
3. Upload company docs if internal
4. Use /import-standards for proprietary tools

### "Standards seem outdated"

**Check:**
- Verify version numbers in stack-config.yaml
- Re-run with explicit versions: `/research-stack Next.js 15`
- Check research_date in stack-config.yaml

**Solution:**
```
/research-stack [stack] --force-refresh
```

### "Generated patterns don't match our needs"

**Remember:** These are starting points based on community standards

**Customize:**
1. Edit files in `.claude/your-stack/`
2. Add your team's preferences
3. Override any patterns
4. Document your reasoning

Framework will respect your customizations

### "Too much/too little information"

**Adjust depth:**
```
/research-stack [stack] --quick    # Less detail
/research-stack [stack] --deep     # More detail
```

---

## Tips for Best Results

### DO

‚úÖ **Be specific about versions** - "Next.js 14" not just "Next.js"
‚úÖ **List all important technologies** - Don't leave out testing, styling, etc.
‚úÖ **Review generated standards** - Make sure they match your needs
‚úÖ **Customize as needed** - Override anything that doesn't fit
‚úÖ **Update periodically** - Re-research when major versions change

### DON'T

‚ùå **Rush through the questions** - Take time to provide complete info
‚ùå **Skip the review** - Always check what was generated
‚ùå **Treat as gospel** - Standards are starting points, adapt them
‚ùå **Forget to commit** - Save standards to version control
‚ùå **Never update** - Refresh standards when stack evolves

---

## After Research

### Next Steps

1. **Review all generated files** in `.claude/your-stack/`
2. **Customize any standards** that don't match your needs
3. **Commit to version control**
   ```bash
   git add .claude/your-stack/
   git commit -m "feat: add stack standards via /research-stack"
   ```
4. **Start building** with `/start-task`
5. **Share with team** so everyone uses same standards

### Integration with Other Commands

Once research is complete, other commands use these standards:

**`/start-task`** - Creates code matching your standards
**`/verify`** - Checks against your standards
**`/learn`** - Teaches based on your stack
**`/create-prd`** - Generates PRDs using your patterns
