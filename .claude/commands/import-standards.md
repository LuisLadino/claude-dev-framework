# /import-standards

**Import or discover coding standards - from documentation OR by analyzing your codebase**

---

## Purpose

Two powerful ways to establish standards:

**Option 1:** Import from existing documentation (Google Drive, PDFs, company handbooks)
**Option 2:** Analyze codebase and discover patterns automatically (no docs needed!)

**Use when:**
- Joining a new company or project
- Contributing to open source
- Inheriting a codebase
- Company has docs but they're outdated
- No documentation exists at all
- Want to understand "the way things are done here"

**Time:** 10-30 minutes depending on codebase size

---

## How It Works

### Option 1: From Documentation
- Read company handbooks, PDFs, wikis
- Convert to framework standards
- Merge with or replace existing standards

### Option 2: From Codebase (⭐ Intelligent Discovery)
- Analyze your entire codebase
- Identify actual patterns in use
- Compare to existing standards (suggest edits)
- Create new standards files if needed
- Discover undocumented conventions

**No scope limits** - analyzes everything:
- Component patterns
- TypeScript/JavaScript conventions
- Styling approaches
- Testing patterns
- File organization
- API design
- State management
- Error handling
- Data fetching
- Hooks/composables
- Utilities
- Configuration
- Build setup
- And more...

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```
/import-standards
```

Claude will ask which option you want.

### Quick Option 1 (From Docs)

```
/import-standards from Google Drive "Engineering Standards"
```

### Quick Option 2 (From Codebase)

```
/import-standards analyze codebase
```

---

## Option 1: Import from Documentation

2. Confluence (via context7 MCP)
3. Notion (via context7 MCP)
4. Local files (markdown, text)
5. Upload files (PDF, Word, etc.)
6. Multiple sources

Select option [1-6]:
```

### Step 2: Finding Documents

**With MCP:**
```
Searching Google Drive...

Found:
1. Engineering Standards v3.2 (2 weeks ago)

## Option 2: Analyze Codebase (⭐ Intelligent Discovery)

### Step 1: Scope Selection

**Claude asks:**
```
What should I analyze?

1. Entire codebase (recommended)
2. Specific directory (e.g., src/components)
3. Specific file types (e.g., *.tsx, *.ts)
4. Custom pattern

Select scope [1-4]:
```

**You choose:** Usually "1" (entire codebase)

### Step 2: Comprehensive Analysis

**Claude performs deep analysis:**

```
🔍 Analyzing codebase...

📁 Scanning project structure...
   ✓ Found 1,247 files
   ✓ Identified 15 directories
   ✓ Detected stack: React + TypeScript + Tailwind

📊 Analyzing patterns...

1️⃣ Component Patterns (analyzing 156 components...)
   ✓ Structure: Functional components, named exports
   ✓ Props: Interface naming pattern I[Component]Props
   ✓ Prop destructuring: Always in function signature
   ✓ Export style: Named exports only (no defaults)
   ✓ File naming: PascalCase (Button.tsx, UserProfile.tsx)
   ✓ Folder structure: Flat in src/components/
   ✓ Index files: No barrel exports detected

   Common patterns found:
   - 143/156 use forwardRef for interactive components
   - 128/156 destructure props in signature
   - 156/156 use named exports
   - 89/156 have co-located test files

2️⃣ TypeScript Patterns (analyzing 843 .ts/.tsx files...)
   ✓ Mode: Strict mode enabled
   ✓ Type definitions: Explicit return types required
   ✓ Interface vs Type: Interfaces for props, types for unions
   ✓ Any usage: None found (strict enforcement)
   ✓ Null handling: Optional chaining preferred
   ✓ Type imports: Using "import type" syntax

   Common patterns:
   - 100% explicit return types on functions
   - 95% use interface for object shapes
   - Type aliases for unions/intersections
   - Const assertions for string literals

3️⃣ Styling Patterns (analyzing 234 styled files...)
   ✓ Primary: Tailwind CSS utility classes
   ✓ Custom CSS: Minimal, only in globals.css
   ✓ Class composition: Using cn() utility
   ✓ Responsive: Mobile-first breakpoints
   ✓ Dark mode: Using class strategy
   ✓ Colors: Semantic tokens from theme

   Common patterns:
   - 198/234 use cn() for conditional classes
   - No inline styles found
   - Consistent spacing scale (4px base)
   - Color usage: Only theme variables

4️⃣ Testing Patterns (analyzing 89 test files...)
   ✓ Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
   ✓ File location: Co-located with components
   ✓ Naming: [ComponentName].test.tsx
   ✓ Structure: describe > it blocks
   ✓ Assertions: expect from @testing-library/jest-dom
   ✓ Mocks: MSW for API mocking

   Common patterns:
   - Test user interactions, not implementation
   - Accessibility queries preferred (getByRole)
   - 78/89 test files have >80% coverage
   - Integration tests over unit tests

5️⃣ State Management (analyzing state patterns...)
   ✓ Global: Zustand stores
   ✓ Server: TanStack Query
   ✓ Forms: React Hook Form
   ✓ URL state: Next.js searchParams
   ✓ Local: useState for simple state

   Common patterns:
   - Zustand for shared client state
   - TanStack Query for all server data
   - No Redux detected
   - Custom hooks for reusable logic

6️⃣ Data Fetching (analyzing API patterns...)
   ✓ Client: TanStack Query (useQuery/useMutation)
   ✓ Server: Next.js Server Components
   ✓ Error handling: Error boundaries
   ✓ Loading: Suspense boundaries
   ✓ Caching: TanStack Query defaults

   Common patterns:
   - Fetch on server when possible
   - TanStack Query for client-side
   - Optimistic updates with useMutation
   - Consistent error handling structure

7️⃣ File Organization (analyzing structure...)
   ✓ Structure: Feature-based folders
   ✓ Components: src/components/ (flat)
   ✓ Hooks: src/hooks/
   ✓ Utils: src/lib/
   ✓ Types: src/types/
   ✓ Tests: Co-located with source

   Common patterns:
   - No deep nesting (max 2 levels)
   - Related files stay together
   - Shared utils in lib/
   - App-specific in features/

8️⃣ Error Handling (analyzing error patterns...)
   ✓ Async errors: try/catch with typed errors
   ✓ Component errors: Error boundaries
   ✓ API errors: Standardized error responses
   ✓ Validation: Zod schemas
   ✓ User feedback: Toast notifications

   Common patterns:
   - Custom error classes
   - Error boundaries at route level
   - Zod for runtime validation
   - Consistent error message format

9️⃣ Hooks & Utilities (analyzing reusable code...)
   ✓ Custom hooks: 34 found in src/hooks/
   ✓ Naming: use[Function] convention
   ✓ Utilities: 67 functions in src/lib/
   ✓ Naming: camelCase, descriptive
   ✓ Tests: 89% have tests

   Common patterns:
   - Hooks extract reusable logic
   - Utils are pure functions
   - Single responsibility
   - Well-typed with generics

🔟 API Design (analyzing API routes...)
   ✓ Framework: Next.js API routes

```

### Step 3: Standards Comparison

**If you have existing standards:**

```
📊 Comparing discovered patterns to existing standards...

✅ Matches (32 patterns):
   - Component file naming (PascalCase) ✓
   - Named exports ✓

   Suggestion: Update standard to match actual practice?
   [Y]es, [N]o, [E]xplain more

3. Test File Naming
   Current standards say: "[name].spec.tsx"
   Codebase actually uses: "[name].test.tsx" (89/89 files)

   Suggestion: Update standard to match actual practice?
   [Y]es, [N]o, [E]xplain more

🆕 Not in Standards (15 patterns):

1. Error Handling Pattern

   Suggestion: Create new "form-standards.md"?
   [Y]es, [N]o, [S]how example first

[... 12 more patterns]
```

**If you have NO existing standards:**

```
📊 No existing standards found. I'll create comprehensive standards from scratch!

Creating standards for:
✓ Component patterns (react-standards.md)
✓ TypeScript conventions (typescript-standards.md)
✓ Styling approach (styling-standards.md)
✓ Testing patterns (testing-standards.md)
✓ File organization (file-structure.md)
✓ State management (state-management-standards.md)
✓ Data fetching (data-fetching-standards.md)
✓ Error handling (error-handling-standards.md)
✓ Form handling (form-standards.md)
✓ API design (api-standards.md)

All standards based on your actual codebase!
```

### Step 4: Interactive Decisions

**For each difference/new pattern:**

**Example 1: Update existing standard**
```
⚠️  Props Interface Naming Mismatch

Current Standard (typescript-standards.md, line 45):
---
Props interfaces should be named [ComponentName]Props

Example:
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
}
---

Discovered Pattern (156/156 components):
---
Props interfaces are named I[ComponentName]Props

Examples found:
- IButtonProps (src/components/Button.tsx)
- IUserProfileProps (src/components/UserProfile.tsx)
- ICardProps (src/components/Card.tsx)
... and 153 more
---

The codebase is 100% consistent with the "I" prefix pattern.

Options:
1. Update standard to match codebase (I[Component]Props)
2. Keep current standard ([Component]Props)
3. Show me more examples
4. Skip for now

Your choice [1-4]:
```

**You choose 1:**
```
✓ Updating typescript-standards.md...

Changed:
- Line 45: "Props interfaces should be named [ComponentName]Props"
+ Line 45: "Props interfaces should be named I[ComponentName]Props"

Added rationale:
"This pattern provides clear visual distinction between interfaces
and other types, and is consistently used across the codebase."

Added examples from actual codebase.
```

**Example 2: Create new standard**
```
🆕 Error Handling Pattern Not Documented

Discovered consistent pattern across 234 files:

Pattern Summary:
- Custom error classes extending Error
- Error boundaries at route level
- Zod for input validation
- Standard error response: { error: string, details?: unknown }
- Toast notifications for user feedback

Example from codebase (src/lib/errors.ts):
---
export class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public details?: unknown) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ValidationError';
  }
}

export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public statusCode: number,
    public details?: unknown
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ApiError';
  }
}
---

Usage found in 89 API routes, 67 client functions.

Create "error-handling-standards.md" with this pattern?

Options:
1. Yes, create new standard
2. Show me full proposed content first
3. Add to existing file instead (which file?)
4. Skip for now

Your choice [1-4]:

## Smart Features

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies consistency (if 90%+ use a pattern, it's standard)
- Detects variations (if 50/50 split, shows both options)
- Finds outliers (highlights inconsistencies for you to fix)

### Intelligent Suggestions
- Updates standards when codebase is more consistent than docs
- Creates new standards for undocumented patterns
- Suggests deprecating unused patterns
- Highlights breaking conventions

### Context-Aware
- Understands framework-specific patterns
- Recognizes ecosystem conventions
- Identifies anti-patterns
- Suggests improvements

---

## Examples

### Example 1: New to Company

**Scenario:** Just joined, no idea what the patterns are

```bash
/import-standards analyze codebase

# Claude analyzes everything
# Discovers all patterns
# Creates comprehensive standards from scratch
# Now you know "the way things are done here"
```

**Result:** Complete standards documentation generated from actual code

### Example 2: Open Source Contribution

**Scenario:** Want to contribute, need to match project style

```bash
/import-standards analyze codebase

# Claude learns project patterns
# Shows you conventions to follow
# Highlights areas where style varies
# Gives you confidence to contribute
```

**Result:** You write code that matches project style perfectly

### Example 3: Docs Out of Sync

**Scenario:** Company has docs but they don't match reality

```bash
/import-standards analyze codebase

# Claude compares docs to actual code
# Shows mismatches (8 found!)
# Suggests updating docs to match code
# Or suggests updating code to match docs
```

**Result:** Standards aligned with actual practices

### Example 4: New Pattern Adopted

**Scenario:** Team started using TanStack Query but no docs exist

```bash
/import-standards analyze codebase

# Claude discovers TanStack Query usage
# Identifies consistent patterns
# Creates data-fetching-standards.md
# Documents what team is already doing
```

**Result:** New pattern officially documented

---

## Advanced Options

### Selective Analysis

**Analyze specific areas:**
```
/import-standards analyze src/components only
/import-standards analyze --type=testing
/import-standards analyze --pattern="*.hook.ts"
```

### Comparison Mode

**Compare to specific standard:**
```
/import-standards analyze --compare-to=typescript-standards.md
```

Shows only differences from that standard.

### Suggestion Mode

**Auto-suggest without asking:**
```
/import-standards analyze --auto-suggest
```

Creates suggested changes, shows you for review, doesn't apply.

### Discovery Only

**Just analyze, don't create files:**
```
/import-standards analyze --report-only
```

Generates analysis report without modifying standards.

# Verify standards match your code
/verify
```

### Commit Changes

```bash
git add .claude/your-stack/
git commit -m "feat: import/discover project standards"
```

### Share with Team

Everyone on team should have same standards:

```bash
git push origin main
# Team members pull to get standards
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ **Analyze early** - Do this when joining project or setting up
✅ **Review suggestions** - Don't blindly accept all changes
✅ **Update periodically** - Re-analyze as codebase evolves
✅ **Commit standards** - Keep in version control
✅ **Share with team** - Ensure everyone has same standards
✅ **Document decisions** - Note why you chose certain patterns

### DON'T

❌ **Skip review** - Always review what gets generated
❌ **Ignore inconsistencies** - If codebase is inconsistent, pick one pattern
❌ **Never update** - Patterns evolve, keep standards current
❌ **Keep outdated** - Remove deprecated patterns from standards
❌ **Work alone** - Discuss significant changes with team

---

## Related Commands

- `/research-stack` - Generate standards from official docs
- `/add-standard` - Add a new custom standard
