## STEP 1: Load Stack Configuration

**Before anything else, load your stack details:**

```
🔧 **LOADING STACK CONFIGURATION**

Reading: .claude/your-stack/stack-config.yaml
```

Use `project_knowledge_search` to find and read stack-config.yaml:
```
Query: "stack-config.yaml stack configuration"
```

**Extract:**
- Framework/library name and version
- Language (TypeScript/JavaScript/etc.)
- Styling solution
- Testing framework
- Package manager
- Active standards files
- Any project-specific settings

**Store this information for the entire workflow**

**If stack-config.yaml not found:**
```
⚠️  Stack configuration not found!

Options:
1. Run /research-stack to set up your stack
2. Run /import-standards if you have company docs
3. Provide stack details manually

Which would you like to do?
```

---

## STEP 2: Understand the Task

Ask clarifying questions about what the user wants:

```
📋 **UNDERSTANDING YOUR REQUEST**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You want to: [user's description]

Let me clarify a few things:

**1. What exactly should this do?**
[If ambiguous, ask for specifics]

**2. Where should this go?**
[Ask about location: which page/component/directory]

**3. Any specific requirements?**
- Styling preferences?
- Data source?
- User interactions?
- Edge cases to handle?

**4. Any existing code to modify or reference?**
[If refactoring or extending]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## STEP 3: Determine Scope & Read Standards

### Find Your Standards

Use `project_knowledge_search` to find applicable standards:

```
Query: "coding standards [framework]"
Query: "architecture patterns"
Query: "testing standards"
Query: "[specific feature] standards"
```

**Search for:**
- Framework-specific standards
- Language standards (TypeScript/JavaScript/etc.)
- Styling standards
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements
- Architecture patterns

### Read CLAUDE.md Core Instructions

Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (the master file) and acknowledge:

**Core Sections to Read:**
- Stack definition & Prime Directive
- Required Reading section
- MANDATORY Workflow
- Edit Protocol
- Code Verification requirements
- Anti-Patterns to avoid
- Enforcement rules

**Verify understanding:**
```
✓ Tech stack: [From stack-config.yaml]
✓ Prime Directive: [Root cause focus, quality over speed]
✓ Required workflow: [Must show checklist, wait for approval]
✓ Edit protocol: [Focused edits, implement ALL features]
```

### Load Active Standards Files

Based on stack-config.yaml `standards_active` field, load:

**Always read:**
```
□ Coding standards for your framework
□ Language standards (TypeScript/JavaScript/etc.)
□ Documentation standards
□ Architecture/file structure
□ Version control standards (if committing)
```

**Conditionally read:**
```
□ Styling standards (if applicable)
□ Testing standards (if tests needed)
□ API standards (if backend work)
□ Database standards (if data layer)
□ Deployment standards (if deploying)
□ Company-specific standards (if imported)
```

**Use project_knowledge_search for each:**
```
Query: "[framework] coding standards"
Query: "[language] standards"
Query: "component patterns"
Query: "testing requirements"
```

---

## STEP 4: Show Complete Standards Check

**⏸️ PAUSE FOR REVIEW**

Show complete checklist for user approval:

```
📋 **STANDARDS CHECK - PLEASE REVIEW**

```

---

## STEP 6: Verification Phase

Before marking complete, verify everything works:

```
🔍 **VERIFICATION PHASE**

Running all checks...
```

### Run Quality Checks

**Format:**
```bash
npm run format
# or: pnpm format, yarn format, etc.
```

**Lint:**
```bash
npm run lint
# or: equivalent in your package.json
```

**Type Check:**
```bash
# For TypeScript projects:
npx tsc --noEmit
# or: npm run type-check
```

**Build:**
```bash
npm run build
# Ensures project builds without errors
```

**Tests:**
```bash
npm test
# or: npm run test
```

### Report Results

```
✅ **VERIFICATION RESULTS**

Format: ✓ Pass
Lint: ✓ Pass
Type Check: ✓ Pass
Build: ✓ Pass
Tests: ✓ Pass (X tests, Y assertions)

All checks passed!
```

### If Any Check Fails

```
❌ **VERIFICATION FAILED**

[Check name] failed:

[Show error details]

**Analysis:**
[Explain what's wrong]

**Fix:**
[Describe what needs to change]

Fixing the issue...

[Apply fix]

Re-running all checks...
```

**Only proceed when ALL checks pass**

---

## STEP 7: Commit Changes

**First, load version control standards:**

Use `project_knowledge_search` to read version-control.md:
```
Query: "version control standards commit format"
```

**Extract from version-control.md:**
- Commit message format (type, scope, structure)
- Allowed commit types (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
- Pre-commit checklist requirements
- Message formatting rules

Then prepare for commit:

```
📦 **PREPARING COMMIT**

**Version Control Standards Loaded:**
✓ Read: .claude/config/version-control.md
  - Commit format: [format from standards file]
  - Types: [allowed types from standards]
  - Pre-commit checks: [checklist items from standards]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Changes to commit:**
- [file1] (new/modified)
- [file2] (modified)
- [test-file] (new)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Suggested Commit Message:**
(Following format from version-control.md)

[type]([scope]): [description]

[body explaining what and why]

Example:
feat(components): add ThemeToggle component

Implement theme switching with light/dark modes.
Persists user preference to localStorage.
Includes keyboard accessibility.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Ready to commit? (yes/no)

Or type custom message if you prefer different wording.
```

**⏸️ WAIT FOR APPROVAL**

### If approved:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[commit message]"
```

```
✅ Committed: [commit hash]
```

## ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL RULES (VIOLATION = UNACCEPTABLE):**

1. **Always load stack-config.yaml first**
   - Cannot proceed without knowing the stack
   - Use project_knowledge_search to find it
   - Extract all relevant configuration

2. **Must show Standards Check**
   - Show complete checklist
   - Wait for user approval
   - Never skip this step

3. **Cannot modify approach without approval**
   - If user says "no", revise the plan
   - Re-show checklist after changes
   - Only proceed with explicit "yes"

4. **All verification must pass**
   - Format, lint, type-check, build, test
   - Fix any failures before proceeding
   - Re-run all checks after fixes

5. **Quality checklist before "done"**
   - Run all verification checks
   - Ensure standards compliance
   - No shortcuts

**If user says "Standards?":**
- Stop immediately
- Execute `/standards` command
- Restart from STEP 1
- Show what was violated

## Tool Usage

### Use project_knowledge_search for:
- Loading stack-config.yaml
- Finding user's custom standards
- Locating framework-specific patterns
- Checking architectural decisions
- Finding existing similar code

### Example queries:
```
"stack configuration yaml"
"[framework] coding standards"
"component architecture patterns"
"testing requirements"
"[feature] implementation examples"
```

### Use web_search for:
- Verifying current best practices (if unsure)
- Checking framework documentation
- Finding recent patterns (post-2024)
- Validating approaches

### Use filesystem (if MCP enabled):
- Reading existing code for patterns
- Finding similar components
- Checking project structure
- Locating configuration files

## Stack-Agnostic Examples

### Example 1: React with TypeScript

```
Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vitest
Task: "Add a button component"

Standards applied:
- React: Functional components, named exports, typed props
- TypeScript: Strict mode, explicit interfaces
- Tailwind: Utility classes, no inline styles
- Testing: Unit tests with React Testing Library

Result: Button.tsx + Button.test.tsx following all standards
```

### Example 2: Vue with JavaScript

```
Stack: Vue 3 + JavaScript + CSS Modules + Vitest
Task: "Add a button component"

Standards applied:
- Vue: Composition API, script setup
- JavaScript: ESLint rules, JSDoc comments
- CSS Modules: Scoped styles, BEM naming
- Testing: Unit tests with Vue Test Utils

Result: Button.vue + Button.test.js following all standards
```

### Example 3: Svelte

```
Stack: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind
Task: "Add a button component"

Standards applied:
- Svelte: Component structure, props typing
- TypeScript: Strict mode, explicit types
- Tailwind: Utility classes
- SvelteKit: File-based routing, load functions

Result: Button.svelte + Button.test.ts following all standards
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find stack-config.yaml"

**Run initial setup:**
```
/research-stack
```

This will create your stack configuration.

### "Standards don't match my code"

**Your standards may need updating:**
1. Review `.claude/your-stack/` directory
2. Update standards files to match your preferences
3. Ensure stack-config.yaml has correct `standards_active` list

### "Verification failing"

**Common causes:**
- Linting rules too strict
- Type errors in existing code
- Test configuration issues
- Build configuration problems

**Solutions:**
1. Fix the specific error shown
2. Update configuration if rules don't match needs
3. Ask for help understanding the error

### "Wrong framework patterns applied"

**Check stack-config.yaml:**
1. Verify framework name and version are correct
2. Ensure standards_active lists correct files
3. Run `/research-stack` to regenerate if needed

---

## Tips for Success

### DO:
✅ Read the standards check carefully
✅ Verify framework/stack is correct
✅ Ask questions if anything is unclear
✅ Review verification results
✅ Use `/learn` after to understand what was built

### DON'T:
❌ Skip the standards check review
❌ Proceed without approval
❌ Ignore verification failures
❌ Commit without running checks
❌ Assume patterns without checking standards
