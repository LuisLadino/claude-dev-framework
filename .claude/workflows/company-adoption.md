## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: "This is too different from what we do"

**Solution:**
```
- Import existing standards first
- Show framework follows their patterns
- Demonstrate on familiar codebase
- Emphasize customization options
- Start with non-critical features
```

### Challenge 2: "I don't trust AI to write code"

**Solution:**
```
- Framework doesn't write code blindly
- You review everything
- Standards are your standards
- AI enforces rules, you make decisions
- Show code review reduction data
```

### Challenge 3: "Takes too long to set up"

**Solution:**
```
- Champions do initial setup
- Pre-import company standards
- Provide ready-to-use config
- Create setup script
- Pair programming for first tasks
```

### Challenge 4: "Our stack isn't supported"

**Solution:**
```
- Use /research-stack to add support
- Framework is stack-agnostic
- Create templates for your stack
- Contribute back to framework
- Start with generic standards
```

### Challenge 5: "Standards are too strict"

**Solution:**
```
- Standards are customizable
- Document when to deviate
- Not about perfection, about consistency
- Can adjust over time
- Balance strictness with pragmatism
```
