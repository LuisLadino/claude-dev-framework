# Web Research Guide

How the Claude Dev Framework uses `web_search` to discover current best practices, validate approaches, and generate accurate standards for any technology stack.

---

## When to Use Web Search

### ‚úÖ Always Search For

1. **Unfamiliar stacks** - If you're working with technologies Claude doesn't know well
2. **Recent changes** - API updates, breaking changes, new patterns (post-2024)
3. **Best practices** - Current community standards and recommendations
4. **Library versions** - Latest stable versions and compatibility
5. **Configuration examples** - Real-world setups that work
6. **Breaking news** - Major deprecations or security issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Usually Don't Need to Search For

1. **Fundamental concepts** - JavaScript basics, HTTP methods, etc.
2. **Stable patterns** - Component composition, REST principles
3. **Your own standards** - Use `project_knowledge_search` instead
4. **Common libraries** - React, Vue, Express (unless checking very recent updates)

---

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Discovery (Broad Search)

**Goal:** Understand the landscape

```
Query: "React TypeScript best practices 2025"
```

**Look for:**
- Official documentation
- Popular blog posts from known authorities
- GitHub repos with high stars
- Recent conference talks
- Community discussions

**Quality indicators:**
- Recent publication date (last 6 months)
- Author credibility (known maintainers, official docs)
- Clear examples with working code
- Engagement (upvotes, stars, comments)

### Phase 2: Validation (Specific Search)

**Goal:** Verify specific approaches

```
Query: "Vite React TypeScript folder structure"
Query: "Next.js 14 app router data fetching"
```

**Look for:**
- Multiple sources confirming the same pattern
- Official documentation alignment
- Active maintenance (not abandoned)
- Real production usage examples

### Phase 3: Deep Dive (Technical Search)

**Goal:** Understand implementation details

```
Query: "shadcn/ui installation Vite"
Query: "Vitest setup with React Testing Library"
```

**Look for:**
- Step-by-step guides
- Common gotchas and solutions
- Version-specific instructions
- Integration examples

---

## Effective Search Queries

### ‚ùå Poor Queries

```
"best way to code" - Too vague
"react" - Too broad
"how to make website" - Not specific enough
"is vue good" - Opinion-based, not actionable
```

### ‚úÖ Good Queries

```
"Next.js 14 app router file structure best practices"
"Astro React integration 2025"
"shadcn/ui Vite setup guide"
"Vitest React Testing Library configuration"
"Tailwind CSS typography plugin usage"
```

### Query Patterns That Work

**For Setup/Configuration:**
```
"[technology] [version] setup guide"
"[library] installation with [framework]"
"[tool] configuration best practices"
```

**For Patterns:**
```
"[framework] folder structure 2025"
"[framework] component patterns"
"[library] common use cases"
```

**For Integration:**
```
"[library A] with [library B] integration"
"how to use [tool] in [framework]"
"[framework] [library] example"
```

**For Troubleshooting:**
```
"[error message] [framework] fix"
"[library] compatibility with [version]"
"[tool] not working with [framework]"
```

## Evaluating Sources

### Trust Levels

**üü¢ Highly Trustworthy:**
- Official documentation (docs.astro.build, react.dev, etc.)
- Official blogs (Vercel blog, Remix blog)
- Library maintainers' personal blogs
- GitHub repos by original authors

**üü° Generally Trustworthy:**
- Major tech publications (Smashing Magazine, CSS-Tricks)
- Well-known developer blogs (Josh Comeau, Kent C. Dodds)

**üî¥ Generally Avoid:**
- Content farms (GeeksforGeeks for recent frameworks)
- AI-generated tutorials (often outdated or wrong)
- Extremely old content (pre-2020 for modern frameworks)
- Single-source claims without verification

### Red Flags

- üö© No code examples
- üö© Last updated 3+ years ago (for modern frameworks)
- üö© Doesn't mention versions
- üö© Contradicts official docs
- üö© "This one weird trick..."
- üö© No attribution or sources
- üö© Broken code examples in comments

### Green Flags

- ‚úÖ Recently updated
- ‚úÖ Working demo links
- ‚úÖ Version numbers specified
- ‚úÖ Multiple confirmations
- ‚úÖ Official stamp of approval
- ‚úÖ Active maintenance
- ‚úÖ Clear explanations with rationale

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Outdated Information

**Problem:** Following tutorials from 2020 for frameworks that changed significantly

**Solution:**
- Always check publication date
- Prefer content from last 6-12 months
- Verify against current official docs
- Search with year: "React best practices 2025"

### 2. Framework Confusion

**Problem:** Applying Next.js patterns to Remix

**Solution:**
- Be explicit in searches: "[specific framework] pattern"
- Understand framework paradigms first
- Don't assume patterns transfer
- Check official migration guides

### 3. Over-Relying on Single Sources

**Problem:** One blog post becomes your entire standard

**Solution:**
- Cross-reference 3-5 sources minimum
- Prioritize official documentation
- Check community consensus
- Verify in production examples

### 4. Ignoring Context

**Problem:** Copying enterprise patterns for small projects

**Solution:**
- Consider project scale
- Read "why" not just "how"
- Adapt patterns to fit
- Start simple, add complexity when needed

## Quality Checklist

After research, ask yourself:

- [ ] Did I check official documentation?
- [ ] Did I find 3+ sources confirming this approach?
- [ ] Is the information recent (last 6-12 months)?
- [ ] Do the examples include versions?
- [ ] Does this match the user's stack and scale?
- [ ] Can I explain *why* this is best practice?
- [ ] Did I check for known issues or gotchas?
- [ ] Is this approach actively maintained?

## Framework Integration

### How /research-stack Uses This

When you run `/research-stack`, the framework:

1. **Searches official docs** for authoritative patterns
2. **Finds popular GitHub repos** to see real-world usage
3. **Checks recent articles** for current best practices
4. **Validates against multiple sources** to ensure accuracy
5. **Synthesizes findings** into clear standards
6. **Generates standards files** for your stack

### How Other Commands Use Research

- `/start-task` - Verifies approaches are current
- `/verify` - Checks against latest best practices
- `/learn` - Finds authoritative learning resources
- `/import-standards` - Validates imported standards against official docs

---

## Tips for Better Research

1. **Be specific:** "Vite React TypeScript" not just "React"
2. **Include versions:** Frameworks change, versions matter
3. **Check dates:** Prefer recent content
4. **Read critically:** Not every blog post is correct
5. **Trust official docs:** They're usually right
6. **Look for patterns:** Multiple sources = likely correct
7. **Understand, don't copy:** Know why, not just what
8. **Verify in production:** Check real repos, not just tutorials
