## Development Process

### Understanding the Structure

```
claude-dev-framework/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                    # Core framework
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/               # Slash commands
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/              # Stack templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/              # Intelligent workflows
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                  # Tool integration docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                       # User documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                    # Helper scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [tracking files]            # Project management
```

### Editing Commands

Commands are in `.claude/commands/*.md`.

**Command file structure:**
- Clear purpose statement
- Step-by-step workflow
- User interaction points
- Error handling
- Examples

**Keep commands:**
- Stack-agnostic (use placeholders)
- User-friendly (clear instructions)
- Robust (handle edge cases)

### Editing Templates

Templates are in `.claude/templates/`.

**Template requirements:**
- Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_react-standards.md`)
- Include placeholder markers: `[YOUR_STACK]`, `[PROJECT_NAME]`
- Provide customization instructions
- Show real examples
- Explain the "why" behind standards

### Editing Documentation

Docs are in `docs/`.

**Documentation standards:**
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide practical examples
- Include code snippets
- Link to related docs
- Test all commands/code

---

## Standards for the Framework

When contributing code or documentation to the framework itself:

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- Be direct and practical
- Use "you" to address users
- Provide real examples
- Explain the "why"
- Be encouraging

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords or jargon without explanation
- Make assumptions about user skill level
- Skip error cases
- Be condescending
- Use "enterprise" language

### Markdown Formatting

```markdown
# H1 for main title only
## H2 for major sections
### H3 for subsections

Use **bold** for emphasis, not _italics_.

Code blocks should specify language:
\`\`\`bash
command here
\`\`\`

Lists use `-` for bullets, not `*`.
```

### Code Examples

All code examples must:
- Work as shown (tested)
- Include comments explaining purpose
- Show realistic scenarios
- Demonstrate best practices

### File Organization

New files should:
- Have a clear, descriptive name
- Include a purpose statement at the top
- Be placed in the logical directory
- Be referenced in relevant docs

## Adding Stack Templates

Stack templates are highly valuable contributions!

### Template Structure

```
.claude/templates/coding-standards/_[framework]-standards.md
```

Example: `_vue-standards.md`

### What to Include

**1. Component Patterns**
```markdown
## Component Structure

Components should use Composition API:

\`\`\`vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

interface Props {
  title: string
  count?: number
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  count: 0
})
\`\`\`

Why: Composition API provides better TypeScript support and is more flexible.
```

**2. File Organization**
```markdown
## File Structure

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature]/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.vue
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.spec.ts
```

**3. Naming Conventions**
```markdown
## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.vue)
- Composables: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useUserData.ts)
- Types: PascalCase (UserProfile)
```

**4. Best Practices**
```markdown
## State Management

Use Pinia for global state:

\`\`\`typescript
// stores/user.ts
export const useUserStore = defineStore('user', () => {
  // setup composition API style
})
\`\`\`

Why: Pinia is Vue 3's official state manager and has excellent TypeScript support.
```

**5. Testing Patterns**
```markdown
## Testing

Test behavior, not implementation:

\`\`\`typescript
it('should display user name when loaded', async () => {
  // Test goes here
})
\`\`\`
```

### Template Checklist

- [ ] Uses framework-specific best practices (not generic)
- [ ] Explains the "why" behind patterns
- [ ] Includes realistic code examples
- [ ] Covers file structure
- [ ] Addresses state management
- [ ] Shows testing patterns
- [ ] Has clear headings
- [ ] References official docs where relevant

### Submitting a Template

1. Create the template in `.claude/templates/coding-standards/`
2. Add examples to `docs/examples/[framework]/`
3. Update `docs/getting-started.md` to mention the framework
4. Submit PR with description of the stack and why this template is valuable
